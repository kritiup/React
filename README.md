# 🚀 React Learning Journey – Daily Log

Welcome to my **React.js learning journey!**  
This repository is a daily log of my progress as I explore the core concepts of React and build hands-on projects. The goal is to develop a solid understanding of modern frontend development through **consistent practice**, **real-world examples**, and **self-driven learning**.
